##Â TCXExtensions

TCXExtension is a library to include additional information about Rowing and Breathing into TCX files. It is designed to work with [TCXZpot](https://github.com/SweetzpotAS/TCXZpot-Java).

### Usage

TCX allows extensions in different nodes in the XML tree. Our extensions are designed to be included into `Trackpoint` nodes and `Activity`nodes, and they can hold information about Rowing or Breathing.

#### Trackpoint Extensions

In **TCXZpot** you can create a `Trackpoint` with the following code:

```java
aTrackpoint()
    .onTime(tcxDate(10, FEBRUARY, 2017, 10, 43, 20))
    .withPosition(position(-3.6733, 36.901))
    .build();
```

This builder has a method `withExtensions()` that accepts a variable number of instances implementing `TCXExtension`. With this library, you can create the following extensions:

- **Rowing**:

```java
rowing().withAcceleration(acceleration(1.0, 2.1, 3.2))
        .withSpeed(metersPerSecond(27.3))
        .withStrokeRate(strokeRate(46))
        .withRawForce(rawForce(1958))
        .build();
```

- **Breathing**:

```java
breathing().withRawBreathing(rawBreathing(391))
           .build();
```

To include them into a `Trackpoint`:

```java
aTrackpoint()
    .onTime(tcxDate(10, FEBRUARY, 2017, 10, 43, 20))
    .withPosition(position(-3.6733, 36.901))
    .withExtensions(rowing().withAcceleration(acceleration(1.0, 2.1, 3.2))
                            .withSpeed(metersPerSecond(27.3))
                            .withStrokeRate(strokeRate(46))
                            .withRawForce(rawForce(1958))
                            .build(),
                    breathing().withRawBreathing(rawBreathing(391))
                               .build())
    .build();
```

#### Activity Extensions

In **TCXZpot** you can create an `Activity` with the following code:

```java
activity(RUNNING)
    .withID(tcxDate(10, FEBRUARY, 2017, 10, 42, 0))
    ...
    .build()
``` 

This builder has a method `withExtensions()` that accepts a variable number of instances implementing `TCXExtension` With this library, you can create the following extensions:

- **Rowing**:

```java
rowing().withAverageHeartRate(bpm(82))
        .withAverageSpeed(metersPerSecond(27.3))
        .withAverageStrokeRate(strokeRate(46))
        .build();
```

To include it into an Activity:

```java
activity(RUNNING)
    .withID(tcxDate(10, FEBRUARY, 2017, 10, 42, 0))
    .withExtensions(rowing().withAverageHeartRate(bpm(82))
                            .withAverageSpeed(metersPerSecond(27.3))
                            .withAverageStrokeRate(strokeRate(46))
                            .build())
    ...
    .build()
``` 

### Download

You can get TCXExtensions from **JCenter** adding this to your Gradle build file:

```groovy
